In November 2022, I finished my PhD from the [School of Informatics](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk), the University of Edinburgh. In my PhD studies, I employed a blend of qualitative and quantitative methodologies to examine the online network dynamics and interactions among Arab atheists, theists, tanweeris, and rationalists on X platform. My PhD was under the supervision of [Dr Walid Magdy](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wmagdy/) and [Dr Maria Wolters](https://mariawolters.net/). In 2018, I completed my [MSc in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees?id=107&r=site/view) at the University of Edinburgh. During my masters I focused on NLP, STN and HCI. My dissertation was about the cultral disengagement among Arab Twitter users. Finally, I completed my [BSc in Computer Engineering (Hons)](https://qu.edu.qa/sites/en_US/engineering/academics/computer/ce) from [Qatar University](https://qu.edu.qa) in Doha, Qatar. For the final year graduation project, we proposed and implemented a metal detection module utilizing the DE0-Nano-SoC platform.
