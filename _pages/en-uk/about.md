I am a Machine Learning and AI Engineer at [Qualitrol Corporation](https://www.qualitrolcorp.com/), where I help drive innovation through Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). My hands-on experience includes:

  - RAG & CAG pipelines
  - Prompt engineering
  - Cloud-native deployments across major platforms

I have a strong background in technical computing and analytics, with experience across both academia and global industry. In a recent role at an international company, I developed chatbots and RAG/CAG systems, fine-tuned pretrained LLMs, and automated processes for customer support, developer assistance, and report generation. These solutions significantly boosted team productivity by enhancing engagement and reducing manual efforts.

I served as a postdoc Research Associate at the [School of Informatics](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk/), [the University of Edinburgh](https://ed.ac.uk/).
I was also a member at [SMASH Research Group](http://smash.inf.ed.ac.uk/), the [Neuropolitics Research Lab](https://neuropolitics.sps.ed.ac.uk/), and the [Digital Influence & Intelligence Lab (DIIL)](https://diilglobal.org/).

My research interests include applying ML and AI to data analytics, computational social science, social and technological network analysis, and data mining.

In November 2022, I completed my PhD at the [School of Informatics](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk), the [University of Edinburgh](https://ed.ac.uk). During my PhD, I used a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to study online network dynamics and community interactions on [X (formerly Twitter)](https://x.com/). I was supervised by [Prof. Walid Magdy](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wmagdy/) and [Dr Maria Wolters](https://mariawolters.net/). In 2018, I completed my [MSc in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees?id=107&r=site/view) at the University of Edinburgh. During my master's I focused on NLP, STN, and HCI. My dissertation was about the cultural disengagement among Arab Twitter users. Finally, I completed my [BSc in Computer Engineering (Hons)](https://qu.edu.qa/sites/en_US/engineering/academics/computer/ce) from [Qatar University](https://qu.edu.qa) in Doha, Qatar. For the BSc graduation project, we proposed and implemented a metal detection module by leveraging the computational and integration capabilities of the FPGA SoC platform.

My journey reflects a strong blend of academic research and industry innovation, with a focus on applying AI to solve real-world problems.
