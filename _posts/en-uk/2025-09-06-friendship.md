My dear, know that companionship is influential. A friend can either lead you to good or pull you astray. Therefore, choose a companion who eases your path, guides you to goodness, and supports you in times of hardship.
This is among the most important values emphasized by Islam, as affirmed in the Qur’an and the Prophetic traditions. Allah Almighty says:

> **“Close friends, that Day, will be enemies to each other, except for the righteous.”**
> \[Az-Zukhruf: 67][^1]

The Prophet ﷺ also said in the hadith of the seven whom Allah will shade on the Day when there is no shade but His:

> **“Two men who love each other for the sake of Allah: they meet upon that and part upon that.”**[^2]

In this hadith, the Prophet ﷺ urges all Muslims to carefully choose companions who will be beneficial both in this world and the Hereafter. A righteous companion is a source of benefit, while a corrupt one brings harm in both realms.



A companion on life’s journey will either be an encourager or a discourager. He may help you rise to noble heights, scale summits, and overcome obstacles—or he may complicate your path, magnify your burdens, weaken your resolve, and beautify failure.

Here, I am reminded of Abu Bakr al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) and his devotion to the companionship of the Prophet ﷺ in all circumstances. Greater still is the Prophet’s own care in choosing him as his companion during the migration to Madinah and their stay together in the cave. How sublime was that noble bond, granting Abu Bakr the honor of companionship in Makkah, in Madinah, and on the blessed migration itself.



Is there any comparison between a friend who clarifies your doubts, takes your hand toward success out of love for you, and one who seizes every opportunity to weaken your resolve and turn you away from the path of achievement?

Be cautious, for those who seek to harm or sabotage you rarely do so openly. Instead, they may disguise it under the guise of advice or concern. When Satan whispered to our forefather Adam and our mother Hawwa (Eve) to lead them out of Paradise, he swore that he was a sincere adviser:

> **“And he swore \[by Allah] to them, ‘Indeed, I am to you from among the sincere advisors.’”**
> \[Al-A‘raf: 21][^3]

Thus, you must remain vigilant. Strive to choose companions who inspire you to succeed, bring you peace of mind, and increase your self-appreciation—so that your journey toward success becomes a beautiful one, shared with sincere friends.


Beware of lending your ear to those who discourage you, or of revealing your distress before them. If you do, you reward them and gladden their hearts—while the only loser is you.

And do not assume that disparagement comes only from those below you, or that discouragement arises solely from your superiority or success. Sometimes, the motive is unclear and unjustified. At times, the discourager may even be regarded as a role model or a symbol of success in society. Yet such a person may not hesitate to weaken the determination of those striving behind him. It is as though he seeks to monopolize success for himself and his circle, refusing to share inspiring stories of achievement with others—unless he himself secures the greater share of it.



Ironically, such people are well aware that sharing success and making it accessible to others—according to what is called the *Abundance vs. Scarcity Mindset*[^4]—is in fact a means to personal growth, enhanced success, and blessings in knowledge, wealth, and effort. Yet, they withhold it.

The impact of success, however, can extend even beyond one’s lifetime. The Prophet ﷺ said:

> **“When a man dies, his deeds come to an end except for three things: Sadaqah Jariyah (ceaseless charity); a knowledge which is beneficial, or a virtuous descendant who prays for him (for the deceased).”**[^5]

And as another narration emphasizes: *“indeed perhaps one present will inform one who understands better than him.”*[^6]
