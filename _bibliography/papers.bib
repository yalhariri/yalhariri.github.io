abstract="Most previous research on online discussions of atheism has focused on atheism within a Christian context. In contrast, discussions about atheism in the Arab world and from Islamic background are relatively poorly studied. An added complication is that open atheism is against the law in some Arab countries, which may further restrict atheist activity on social media. In this work, we explore atheistic discussion in the Arab Twittersphere. We identify four relevant categories of Twitter users according to the content they post: atheistic, theistic, tanweeri (religious renewal), and other. We characterise the typical content posted by these four sets of users and their social networks, paying particular attention to the topics discussed and the interaction among them. Our findings have implication for the study of religious and spiritual discourse on social media and provide a better cross-cultural understanding of relevant aspects.",

abstract = {In this study, we investigate the extent of polarisation among theist versus atheist groups on Arab Twitter and their networks. We find four main self-identified groups of Arab users that can be distinguished by different attitudes to religion. In addition to Atheists and Theists, there are Rationalists, who promote rational thinking regardless of religious affiliation, and Tanweeri, who promote religious reforms. Through a keyword search of Twitter account handles and biographies, we identified 2,673 active, public Twitter accounts that clearly state whether they are Atheists, Theists, Tanweeri or Rationalists and analysed the interactions among themselves and the accounts that are followed, retweeted, or mentioned the most in their networks. Depending on the network analysed, we found between four and seven sub-communities that highlight the rich socio-cultural context in which discussions of religion, non-religion, and religious reform unfold. While there was clear online polarisation between atheists and theists, Rationalist and Tanweeri accounts are spread among the two polarised sides, acting as natural bridges. We also found a clear separation between Arab atheists who engage with Arab accounts promoting atheism and those who primarily engage with Western accounts promoting atheism. We discuss implications for the study of religious debate and religious polarisation on social media.},

title = "Sustainability tweeting triumphs during the COP events: analyzing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) communication on Twitter",
abstract = "Purpose: With the upcoming COP 28 event in the United Arab Emirates, this study delves into the tweeting behavior of firms during COP events. We analyze all ESG tweets throughout COP 26 and COP 27 events, aiming to unravel the intricate connections between social media communication, industry characteristics, and financial performance. Design/methodology/approach: this study adopts a grounded theory approach to gain insights into the ESG and sustainability-focused initiatives undertaken by companies on social media, with a specific focus on the discourse surrounding climate change issues. Employing social media analytics, we conducted an in-depth analysis of ESG-related tweets from S&P 500 firms to discern the nature of their reporting and examine potential correlations with financial performance using the higher Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CARs) model.Findings: Our research findings introduce four novel distinct groups—Unengaged, Catalysts, Cautious, and Shapers—based on firms' proactive or reactive sustainability communication patterns. Our results explore the potential impact of COP event locations on tweeting behavior, proposing that conferences held in different regions, such as Asia versus Europe, may elicit varied reactions from S&P 500 firms. In terms of legitimacy, the study finds no significant differences in tweeting characteristics between industries. However, it uncovers a correlation between firms' CARs and their membership in specific tweeting groups, emphasizing that financial performance is intricately linked to social media communication patterns. The results challenge the simplistic view that higher social media engagement leads to positive financial outcomes, suggesting instead that lower financial performance may drive firms to adopt more extreme communication patterns, possibly as a strategic move to enhance corporate legitimacy.",

  abstract= "Modern day robotics is fast developing and evolving in various areas of multi sensor applications like body sensor networks and mine detection. A flexible platform that can be easily integrated into variety of sensors is very essential in any complex environment. A reconfigurable hardware provides a suitable platform to identify and improve existing models used in metal detection industry. In this paper, we propose and implement a metal detection module using Terasic Spider Robot, planned to be used in landmine detection operations. A hardware circuit model to detect metal was designed for the metal detection module and embedded on the TSR. The on board control system was implemented using a reconfigurable DE0 Nano System on Chip platform that can further process the information from the metal detector using efficient algorithm. The movement of the TSR was controlled remotely by Bluetooth using a smartphone app designed specifically for this application. The design also intimates the user with a message on detecting the metal. The design was implemented successfully and the metal detection module detected buried metals at a depth of maximum 7cm.",

abstract= "While usable water on earth is sparse and costly to treat, statistics show excessive use worldwide. Penalties are issued to limit the excessive consumption; however, their impact is marginal as they do not identify the reason for the exorbitant consumption. Therefore, giving users the full awareness about their water consumption will greatly help in minimizing the water waste. This article aims to present a smart self-powered water monitoring system that leverages IoT and cloud computing. The system consists of an IoT device that can be installed at any water source, a cloud application to receive the data from the devices, and a mobile app to visualize the water consumption at every monitored source. This system gives the user the ability to identify the location and time of the excessive usage and leaks on the mobile phone. Experiment results confirm the self-powered premise of the solution. A prototype of mobile application and backend have been developed and tested.",
